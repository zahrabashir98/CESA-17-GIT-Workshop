Some brief git courses that held up at IUST by me (Sep2018, June 2019)
## Switch to presentation branch to download slides
## Switch to Commonsyntaxes branch to see some commands told in workshop
## Switch to TeamWorkByGit branch for a little bit advanced information about team working and collaboration in git.
